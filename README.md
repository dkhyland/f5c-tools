# f5c-tools

Here are some scripts that are used for benchmarking and tuning f5c parameters
To use the scripts, clone this repository to get the folder structure and then build f5c following the instructions from https://github.com/dkhyland/f5c (forked from Hasindu Gamaarachchi's repo https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c).
After this, run the scripts with the -h flag for further instruction on usage.
